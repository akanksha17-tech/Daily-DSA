   # Welcome to the Daily-DSA Repository

   This repository is for daily coding challenges related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

   ## Contribution Guidelines

   - Fork this repository.
   - Create a new folder with your name under `DSA-contributors`.
   - Solve a coding problem and place the code in your folder.
   - Provide a problem statement or a link to the problem in the code comments.
   - Create a pull request to this repository with your changes.
   - Wait for the maintainers to review and merge your contribution.
   ```

2. **Create a "DSA-contributors" Directory**:
   In your GitHub repository, create a directory named "DSA-contributors" to allow contributors to organize their code.

   ```bash
   git mkdir DSA-contributors
   git commit -m "Create DSA-contributors directory"
   git push
   ```

3. **Contributors Fork and Add Their Code**:
   Instruct contributors to follow these steps:

   - Fork your repository on GitHub.
   - Clone their forked repository to their local machine.
   - Create a folder in the "DSA-contributors" directory with their name, e.g., "DSA-JohnDoe."
   - Solve a coding problem and place the code in their folder.
   - Include a comment or a link to the problem statement within their code.

4. **Contribute and Create a Pull Request**:
   Contributors should commit their changes, push them to their forked repository, and then create a pull request to your repository. In the pull request description, they can explain their contribution and provide a link to the problem statement they solved.

5. **Review and Merge Contributions**:
   As the repository owner, you can review the pull requests from contributors, ensure that the code and comments meet your project's standards, and then merge the contributions.

This setup allows contributors to organize their code, provides a clear contribution process, and enables you to easily review and merge their contributions.
